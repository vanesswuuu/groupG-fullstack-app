## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Database Setup (Local Development):**
   - Open a PostgreSQL instance and note your credentials
   - Update `config.json` with your database credentials:
     ```json
     "database": {
         "host": "localhost",
         "port": 5432,
         "user": "postgres",
         "password": "[SET PostgreSQL Password here]",
         "database": "user_management_db"
     }
     ```

2. **Email Configuration (Test Environment):**
   - Use Gmail's SMTP server for sending verification and notification emails.
   - You may need to generate an **App Password** if 2FA is enabled on your account.
   - Configure SMTP settings in `config.json`:
     ```json
     "smtpOptions": {
         "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
         "port": 465,
         "secure": true,
         "auth": {
             "user": "[YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS]",
             "pass": "[YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD]"
         },
         "from": "User Management System <raileyalin@gmail.com>"
     }
     ```

3. **Application Startup:**
   - In the root directory, open a command prompt and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend server (in first terminal):
     ```bash
     npm run start:backend
     ```
   - Start the frontend Angular app (in second terminal):
     ```bash
     npm run start:frontend
     ```
